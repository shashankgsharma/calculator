# calculator
A simple calculator that takes input two numbers and prints out the result, where the result can be passed again, or a new calculation can be initiated.
This calculator can be terminate on user's demand, unlike the calculator showed by Angela Yu in the day 10 project of #100DaysOfPython.
It also includes a NOT DEFINED condition when user tries to divide a number by zero, while the default calculation reverts to user entering a pair of new numbers for further calculation.
